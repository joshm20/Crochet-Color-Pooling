I recommended using VS Code as your code editor.

To setup your repository:
1. Make a GitHub account. I recommend using a personal email.
2. Download GitHub Desktop on your computer.
3. Open GitHub Desktop and log in to your GitHub account.
4. In the top left, click file, then click clone repository. Go to the URL tab, and put in this URL: https://github.com/joshm20/Crochet-Color-Pooling.
5. Choose an empty folder to clone the repository to. I recommend using the default folder location that GitHub automatically fills in for you.
5. Click clone to clone the repository to your computer.
6. In GitHub Desktop, click "Open in Visual Studio Code"
7. Voila
