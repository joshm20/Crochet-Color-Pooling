# Crochet Color Pooling
Crochet Color Pooling is a public repository made for experimenting with the source code of the Chrochet Color Pooling website.
Access the original website by Dr. Laura Taalman [here.](https://mathgrrl.com/crochet-color-pooling/)

# Recommended things to do:

- Display fraction being used on the screen (Easy)
- Add sum for total number of stitches (Easy)
- Allow user to choose between different fractions and +/- 1, eliminate undefined error
- Reverse input for number of stitches and distribute into different. (Hard)
  

# Environment Setup
I recommended using VS Code as your code editor. You can download VS Code here: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

To use this and add changes, you need to download Git, a source code manager for projects. If you don't know, Git manages different users working asynchronously, timelines of changes, and so much more. Use this page to download Git: https://git-scm.com/downloads
For deciding which options to choose in the Git installer, I would say to just use the default options unless you know what you're doing. When asked to pick your code editor, choose VS Code.

To setup your repository:
1. Make a GitHub account. I recommend using a personal email.
2. Download GitHub Desktop on your computer from here: https://desktop.github.com/
3. Open GitHub Desktop and log in to your GitHub account.
4. In the top left, click file, then click clone repository. Go to the URL tab, and put in this URL: https://github.com/joshm20/Crochet-Color-Pooling
5. Choose a folder to clone the repository to; I recommend using the default folder location that GitHub automatically fills in for you.
6. Click clone to clone the repository to your computer.
7. In GitHub Desktop, click "Open in Visual Studio Code"
8. I'm not sure if it is required, but I would suggest you to log in to GitHub in VS Code too.
9. Voila


To launch the website locally in VS Code:
1. Download the extension: Live Server by Ritwick Dey
2. Right click on "crochet-color-pooling.html" in the "site" folder.
3. Click "Open with Live Server"
4. The website should open in your preferred browser with the same functionality (Hopefully)
